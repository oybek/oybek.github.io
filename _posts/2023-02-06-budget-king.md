title: "Budget King: Building PC on top of i3-12100"
tags: [hardware]

On Q1'2022 intel had released lots of new CPUs. And among them
there is a processor, which has become a budget king at the moment
of writing this blogpost. It is intel core i3 12100.

I decided to assemble the new workstation based on this CPU.
And after working with it for about 2 weeks I can honestly say that
this CPU is a real monster.
