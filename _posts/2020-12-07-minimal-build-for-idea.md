Laptops nowadays are very often used as desktop workstations. All my friends use their laptops
plugging them to 1 or more big monitors. And I used to do the same until the speed of my weak laptop began to annoy me.

It has become a problem. During slow compilation I was losing a lot of time when I was concentrated.

I got 2 solutions of my problem:
1. To buy more powerful laptop (which is quite expensive)
2. To build PC myself (much more cheap way)

So here are the list of basic parts of PC for comfortable programming:
* CPU (With integrated graphics)
* Motherboard (With m2 port or sata, and support for hybrid CPUs)
* RAM (About 8 or 16 Gb)
* SSD (NVME or Sata)

Tips: no need to buy graphics card, it is a waste of money in our case. Ram has to be 2 ranked or 2 sticks. One stick
with 1 rank will be the bottleneck in our system, cause CPU will use RAM also for graphics.
Of course, we will choose SSD it gives fast file access during compilation.

Here is the list of components I used and tested:

## CPU: AMD A8-9600

|-|-|
**Price** | About 3000 rub. (~40 $)
**Cores** | 4 (3.1-3.4 GHz)
**TDP** | Just 65W
**Shader cores** | 384 (900 MHz)

## Motherboard: ASUS Prime a320m-k

**M2** | +

## RAM: Kingston HyperX 8Gb (4x2) DDR4

|-|-|
**Price** | About 2000 rub. (~27 $)

## SSD: Samsung, Gigabyte or Kingston (240 Gb)

Other parts you could buy whichever you want. They don't affect system properties.
