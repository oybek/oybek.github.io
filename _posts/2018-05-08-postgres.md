Short guide about how to setup postgres on linux without pain and system pollution using single directory.

Download Postgres binaries from [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries)
(I don't like to install from repos, because it pollutes system).

Extract archive content to some folder:

```sh
tar -xvzf postgresql-10.4-1-linux-x64-binaries.tar.gz 
```

Configure `PATH` variable. Add following code to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```sh
POSTGRES_HOME=/home/user/.stack/pgsql
export PATH="$POSTGRES_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Restart terminal or just execute `source ~/.bashrc`. Now you have postgres binaries in your
`$PATH` so u can call them everywhere.

Create folder where you want postgres keep its files:

```sh
mkdir /home/user/pg_data
```

Initialize folder with postgres:

```sh
initdb /home/user/pg_data
```

Start the database server:

```sh
pg_ctl -D /home/user/pg_data -l pg_data/logfile start
```

> You can stop database server by following command:
>
> ```sh
> pg_ctl -D /home/user/pg_data stop
> ```

Create the user `postgres` with super user privileges:

```sh
createuser --superuser postgres
```

Create data base:

```sh
createdb --echo-all --owner=postgres testdb
```

> Now you can connect to db with command:
> 
> ```sh
> psql --echo-all --dbname testdb --user postgres
> ```
