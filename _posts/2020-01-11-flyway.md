My speech dump for the lecture about "Flyway" at work.

Again I decided to prepare a report because of a lot of questions came to me
during the usage of another technology. This time it is "Flyway" db migration tool.

Here are the questions:
* What is the data base schema migration?
* Why do we need special tool for doing migrations?
* How "Flyway" manages migrations?
  * What is checksum, why do we need it?
  * What is CRC32?
* "Flyway" functionality overview
* What to do if I want to change migration script?

## What is the data base schema migration?

It is kind of revision control on database schemas. You define your schema as
the sequence of sql scripts (or another format), when applying each of sql script
upgrades your table schema. So you'll get your database schema and code connected
within version control.

## Why do we need special tool for doing migrations?
