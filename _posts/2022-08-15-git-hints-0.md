## The problem

### Given

```
o-o-o-o [master]
      ╰-o-o-o [branch-x]
```

### Need

Create the new branch (`branch-y`), and have changes of `branch-x` on it.
`u` stands for uncommited changes.

```
o-o-o-o [master]
      ╰-o-o-o [branch-x]
      ╰-u [branch-y]
```

### Solution

```
git checkout master
git checkout -b branch-y
git diff master branch-x | git apply
```

### Solution check

```
git checkout branch-y
[[ `git diff branch-x | wc -l` == 0 ]] && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"
```

### When used

Sometimes you have to create the copy of the branch with all commits squashed into the one.
